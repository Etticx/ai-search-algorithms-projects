# ðŸ“‚ Blind Search Algorithms

Blind (or uninformed) search algorithms explore a search space without extra knowledge about the goal, other than the problem definition. They are fundamental for understanding how AI systematically explores possible states.

## ðŸ”Ž Algorithms in this section
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  Explores nodes level by level and always finds the shortest path in terms of number of steps.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** *(coming soon)*  
  Explores as far as possible down one path before backtracking.
