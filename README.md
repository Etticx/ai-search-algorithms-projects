## Introduction

This repository is aimed at students and beginners who want to learn AI problem-solving techniques. It includes both **uninformed search** (blind search) and **informed search** (heuristic search) algorithms, as well as **adversarial game search** algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Uninformed (Blind) Search
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  

### Informed (Heuristic) Search
- **Best-First Search**  
- **A\* Search**  

### Adversarial Game Search
- **Minimax Algorithm**  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
